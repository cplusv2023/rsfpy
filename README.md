# rsfpy

**rsfpy** is a Python toolkit for reading, writing, and manipulating *Madagascar RSF* (Regularly Sampled Format) scientific datasets.  
Built on top of NumPy, it supports efficient slicing, transposing, and subsampling, while automatically updating metadata (e.g., n#/o#/d#/label#/unit#) to keep axis descriptions consistent with data transformations.

## ✨ Features

- 📂 **Data I/O**: Read and write RSF format files
- ⚡ **High performance**: NumPy-based for large-scale data processing
- 🔄 **Metadata sync**: Automatically updates axis information during operations
- 🛠 **Clean API**: Intuitive interface for research workflows
- 🌍 **Applications**: Geophysics, signal processing, seismic imaging, and more
