# rsfpy

**rsfpy** is a Python toolkit for reading, writing, and manipulating [*Madagascar*](https://ahay.org "Madagascar Main Page") [<ins>*RSF* (Regularly Sampled Format) </ins>](https://ahay.org/wiki/Guide_to_RSF_file_format "RSF data format")  scientific datasets.  
Built on top of [*NumPy*](https://numpy.org/ "The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python"), it supports efficient slicing, transposing, and subsampling, while automatically updating metadata (e.g., n#/o#/d#/label#/unit#) to keep axis descriptions consistent with data transformations.

## ✨ Features

- 📂 **Data I/O**: Read and write RSF format files
- ⚡ **High performance**: NumPy-based for large-scale data processing
- 🔄 **Metadata sync**: Automatically updates axis information during operations
- 🛠 **Clean API**: Intuitive interface for research workflows
- 🌍 **Applications**: Geophysics, signal processing, seismic imaging, and more

## 📦 Installation

pip install .
```
